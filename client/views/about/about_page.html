      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>Hi there! Fitloop.co is a tool I built for learning fitness exercises, routines, and best practices using minimal exercise equipment (mostly bodyweight).</p>

      <p>I found a wealth of information on online forums and communities, but found it daunting to sift through to find the information I was looking for. Whereas one page might provide a routine to follow, another would provide details on each exercise, and yet another would link to youtube videos. Fitloop combines all these individual pieces of data into a usable tool, where the information is available in bits where it is relevant.</p>

      <p>Personally, I am still working on my goals and using Fitloop to acheive them. I work on improvements to the site as I progress, adding features which will help me. I have more features planned that will allow users to track progress, keep them motivated to exercise, and provide some basic nutrition information.</p>

      <p>Thank you for visiting, I hope you find this site useful! If you have any questions/comments, please email me at <a href="mailto:hi@fitloop.co">hi@fitloop.co</a>.</p>

      <p>Remember to keep safe, exercise caution and good judgement. Good luck!</p>
